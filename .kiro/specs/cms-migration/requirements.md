# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a major reset and migration from the existing Phoenix-based application to Strapi CMS - a professional, turn-key content management solution. This is a complete architectural overhaul that will replace the current system with Strapi's production-ready CMS while maintaining integration with the existing Unreal Engine 5 game backend and pixel streaming infrastructure.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a content administrator, I want Strapi's professional admin interface to manage all game content, user data, and system configurations, so that I can efficiently maintain the platform with a production-ready, turn-key CMS solution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator accesses the CMS THEN KeystoneJS SHALL provide a modern web-based admin interface with built-in authentication
2. WHEN content is created or modified THEN the system SHALL immediately update the GraphQL API endpoints
3. WHEN the admin interface loads THEN it SHALL provide intuitive content management for all game-related data types
4. IF an administrator lacks proper permissions THEN KeystoneJS SHALL enforce role-based access controls

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want new clean API endpoints generated by KeystoneJS to serve game data to the Unreal Engine 5 client, so that the game can consume content through modern GraphQL and REST APIs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN KeystoneJS is configured THEN it SHALL automatically generate GraphQL and REST API endpoints for all content types
2. WHEN a game client makes an API request THEN the system SHALL respond with properly structured JSON data
3. WHEN new content types are added THEN the API SHALL automatically include endpoints for the new types
4. IF API requests fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and proper HTTP status codes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to start fresh with a clean KeystoneJS installation and new user management system, so that we have a modern foundation without legacy technical debt.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN KeystoneJS is installed THEN it SHALL provide a fresh database schema with modern user management
2. WHEN the new system launches THEN it SHALL have clean, optimized data structures for game content
3. WHEN users register THEN they SHALL use the new KeystoneJS authentication system
4. IF legacy data needs to be referenced THEN it SHALL be available for manual migration of specific content only

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want KeystoneJS to replace the Phoenix application entirely while maintaining Docker deployment capabilities, so that we have a simpler, more modern deployment pipeline.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN KeystoneJS is deployed THEN it SHALL run as the primary application in Docker containers
2. WHEN environment variables are configured THEN KeystoneJS SHALL use standard Node.js environment configuration
3. WHEN the application starts THEN KeystoneJS SHALL serve both the admin interface and game APIs
4. IF the service fails THEN Docker SHALL provide automatic restart capabilities and health checks

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to manage game-specific content types like quests, items, characters, and game configurations through KeystoneJS, so that I can update game content through an intuitive admin interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating game content THEN KeystoneJS SHALL provide custom schema definitions for quests, items, characters, and game configurations
2. WHEN content is published THEN the GraphQL API SHALL immediately serve the updated content
3. WHEN content has relationships THEN KeystoneJS SHALL automatically handle referential integrity and provide relationship UI
4. IF invalid content is submitted THEN KeystoneJS SHALL validate data using schema validation and provide clear error messages

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want KeystoneJS to provide real-time capabilities and admin dashboards to replace the Phoenix LiveView functionality, so that we have modern real-time features built into the CMS.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN real-time game events occur THEN KeystoneJS SHALL provide WebSocket or Server-Sent Events for live updates
2. WHEN admin users view dashboards THEN they SHALL see real-time game statistics and player activity
3. WHEN data changes occur THEN connected clients SHALL receive immediate updates through KeystoneJS real-time features
4. IF real-time connections fail THEN the system SHALL gracefully fall back to periodic data refresh

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want KeystoneJS to provide modern authentication and authorization capabilities, so that the system has robust security built on current best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users authenticate THEN KeystoneJS SHALL use its built-in session management and authentication system
2. WHEN API requests are made THEN KeystoneJS SHALL enforce role-based access controls and field-level permissions
3. WHEN sensitive data is accessed THEN the system SHALL log access attempts using KeystoneJS audit capabilities
4. IF unauthorized access is attempted THEN KeystoneJS SHALL block access and log security events

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain integration with the existing Unreal Engine 5 game and pixel streaming infrastructure, so that the game client continues to work with the new backend.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game client connects THEN it SHALL successfully authenticate against KeystoneJS APIs
2. WHEN pixel streaming is active THEN KeystoneJS SHALL provide game session management and player data
3. WHEN game events occur THEN they SHALL be logged and tracked through KeystoneJS data models
4. IF game integration fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback mechanisms

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a production-ready deployment with SSL encryption and simplified architecture, so that the system is secure and maintainable for production use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is deployed THEN it SHALL use Let's Encrypt SSL certificates for HTTPS
2. WHEN services start THEN there SHALL be only ONE primary backend service (KeystoneJS) instead of multiple competing backends
3. WHEN SSL certificates expire THEN they SHALL automatically renew without manual intervention
4. IF SSL setup fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback to development mode
