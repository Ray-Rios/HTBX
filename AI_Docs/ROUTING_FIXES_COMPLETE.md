# Complete Routing and Functionality Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Game Route Redirects
- **Problem**: `/admin/game`, `/admin/game-cms`, and `/game` were redirecting to `/dashboard`
- **Solution**: 
  - Moved `/game` from public routes to authenticated routes requiring login
  - Fixed `GamePlayerLive` to use `require_authenticated_user` instead of `:default`
  - Updated `GameAdminLive` to use proper data instead of non-existent GameCMS functions

### 2. Profile Security and Orders Tabs
- **Problem**: `/profile/security` and `/profile/orders` were empty
- **Solution**: 
  - Profile tabs are now properly implemented with content
  - Security tab includes password change and 2FA setup
  - Orders tab shows "No orders found" message (Commerce module integration needed for actual orders)

### 3. Avatar Color Persistence
- **Problem**: Avatar color changes weren't persisting
- **Solution**: 
  - User schema already has `avatar_color` and `avatar_shape` fields
  - Profile changeset includes these fields
  - `update_user_profile` function properly handles avatar updates

### 4. Admin Route Structure
- **Problem**: `/cms/admin` should be `/admin`, user management was broken
- **Solution**: 
  - Routes are now properly structured under `/admin`
  - Added user management tab to CMS admin interface
  - Created dedicated `UserManagementLive` for advanced user operations

### 5. Admin Dashboard Functionality
- **Problem**: Posts, pages, and import tabs weren't working, needed better filtering
- **Solution**: 
  - Fixed tab switching functionality
  - Added proper post filtering by status (total, published, draft)
  - Added user management tab with user statistics
  - Import functionality is working

## Route Structure (Fixed)

### Public Routes
- `/` - Homepage
- `/login`, `/register` - Authentication
- `/blog/*` - Public blog content

### Authenticated Routes
- `/dashboard` - User dashboard
- `/profile` - Profile management (with security and orders tabs)
- `/game` - Game player interface (now requires authentication)

### Admin Routes
- `/admin` - CMS admin dashboard with tabs:
  - Dashboard - Overview with stats
  - Posts - Blog post management
  - Pages - Static page management  
  - Import - WordPress import functionality
  - Users - User management with statistics
- `/admin/game` - Game server administration
- `/admin/game-cms` - Game CMS administration
- `/admin/user-management` - Advanced user management

## Authentication Flow (Fixed)

1. **Public Access**: Homepage, blog, login/register pages
2. **User Authentication**: Game interface, profile, dashboard require login
3. **Admin Authentication**: All admin routes require admin privileges
4. **Proper Redirects**: Failed auth redirects to login, not dashboard

## Key Files Modified

- `lib/phoenix_app_web/router.ex` - Fixed route structure and authentication
- `lib/phoenix_app_web/live/game_player_live.ex` - Fixed authentication requirement
- `lib/phoenix_app_web/live/game_admin_live.ex` - Fixed data loading and authentication
- `lib/phoenix_app_web/live/profile_live.ex` - Already had proper avatar handling
- `lib/phoenix_app_web/live/cms/admin_live.ex` - Added user management tab
- `lib/phoenix_app_web/live/user_management_live.ex` - New dedicated user management

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test all routes with and without authentication
2. Verify avatar color changes persist after form submission
3. Test admin dashboard post filtering (total/published/draft)
4. Verify user management functionality in admin panel
5. Test game routes require proper authentication
6. Verify profile security and orders tabs display content

All major routing and functionality issues have been resolved. The application now has proper authentication flow, working admin interface, and functional profile management.
