# EQEmu Simplified Approach - Start Small, Scale Smart

## 🤔 **The Reality Check**

You're absolutely right - the full PEQ database is overkill and would be a performance nightmare for GraphQL. Let's be practical:

### **What You Actually Need to Start**
- ✅ **~20 characters** (not 10,000+)
- ✅ **~100 essential items** (not 100,000+)
- ✅ **~10 zones** (not 500+)
- ✅ **Basic character stats** (not 240 fields)
- ✅ **Simple inventory** (not complex augmentation system)

### **GraphQL Performance Reality**
- ❌ **100k items in GraphQL** = Slow queries, memory issues
- ❌ **240 item fields** = Massive payload sizes
- ❌ **Complex relationships** = N+1 query problems
- ✅ **Small, focused dataset** = Fast, responsive API

## 🎯 **Smart Strategy: Curated Game Data**

Instead of importing the entire PEQ database, let's create a curated EverQuest experience:

### **Phase 1: Minimal Viable EverQuest**
```elixir
# Characters (5 essential fields)
- name, level, race, class, zone_id

# Items (10 essential fields)  
- name, damage, delay, ac, hp, mana, classes, races, slots, level_req

# Zones (5 essential fields)
- name, safe_x, safe_y, safe_z, min_level

# Inventory (3 essential fields)
- character_id, item_id, slot_id
```

### **Phase 2: Add Complexity Gradually**
Only add more fields/tables when you actually need them in your UE5 game.

## 🚀 **Practical Implementation**

Let me create a much simpler schema that gives you a working EverQuest system without the complexity:
