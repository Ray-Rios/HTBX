# Routing Fixes Summary

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. **UndefinedFunctionError at GET /admin**
- **Problem**: `AdminDashboardLive` module didn't exist
- **Fix**: Changed `/admin` route to use `CMS.AdminLive` instead
- **Result**: `/admin` now works and shows the CMS admin interface

### 2. **Admin Routes Redirecting to Dashboard**
- **Problem**: `/admin/game` and `/admin/game-cms` were redirecting incorrectly
- **Fix**: Properly configured admin routes with correct authentication
- **Result**: 
  - `/admin/game` → Game monitoring admin panel ✅
  - `/admin/game-cms` → Game CMS management panel ✅

### 3. **Dashboard Mismatched Links**
- **Problem**: Dashboard cards had wrong paths and missing links
- **Fix**: Updated dashboard to include proper links:
  - Added **Game** card linking to `/game`
  - Added **Unreal Engine** card linking to `/unreal`
  - Fixed all existing card links to use correct paths
  - Added admin-only cards for Game Admin and Game CMS

### 4. **Galaxy Routes Removal**
- **Problem**: Unwanted galaxy-related routes and files
- **Fix**: Completely removed:
  - `/galaxy-test` route and `GalaxyTestLive` ❌
  - `/galaxy` route and `SimpleGalaxyLive` ❌
  - `/galaxy-demo` route and `DemoGalaxyLive` ❌
  - All related files: `galaxy_live.ex`, `galaxy_simulation.ex`, `galaxy_hook.js`, etc. ❌

### 5. **Game Route Fixed**
- **Problem**: `/game` was redirecting to dashboard
- **Fix**: Ensured `/game` route properly loads `GamePlayerLive`
- **Result**: `/game` now shows the pixel streaming game interface ✅

### 6. **Profile Security and Orders Content**
- **Problem**: Missing content for `/profile/security` and `/profile/orders`
- **Fix**: Added complete implementations:
  - **Security tab**: Password change form, 2FA setup with QR codes
  - **Orders tab**: Order history display (currently shows empty state)

### 7. **Avatar Color Fix**
- **Problem**: Avatar color changes weren't being saved
- **Fix**: Updated `User.profile_changeset` to include avatar fields
- **Result**: Avatar color and shape changes now persist ✅

### 8. **CMS Admin Route Simplification**
- **Problem**: `/cms/admin` was confusing
- **Fix**: Moved CMS admin to `/admin` (main admin interface)
- **Result**: Single admin interface at `/admin` ✅
