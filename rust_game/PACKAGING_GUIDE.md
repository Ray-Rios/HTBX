# UE5 Packaging Guide - Fix for Fab Plugin Error

## ðŸš¨ The Problem
You're getting this error when packaging:
```
LogWindows: Error: Assertion failed: CurrentApplication.IsValid()
PackagingResults: Error: Unknown Cook Failure
```

This is caused by the **Fab plugin** trying to initialize UI components during headless packaging.

## âœ… Solution 1: Fixed Command Line (Try This First)

```bash
cd rust_game
bash package-ue5-fixed.sh
```

The fixed script:
- Disables the Fab plugin via environment variable
- Uses proper headless packaging arguments
- Handles UE5.4 specific issues

## âœ… Solution 2: Manual Packaging (Most Reliable)

### Step 1: Open Project in UE5 Editor
1. **Launch Epic Games Launcher**
2. **Go to Unreal Engine tab**
3. **Click "Launch" on UE5.4**
4. **Open Project**: Browse to `rust_game/ActionRPGMultiplayerStart.uproject`

### Step 2: Disable Problematic Plugins
1. **Edit â†’ Plugins**
2. **Search for "Fab"**
3. **Uncheck "Enabled"** for Fab plugin
4. **Restart Editor** when prompted

### Step 3: Package the Game
1. **File â†’ Package Project â†’ Windows (64-bit)**
2. **Choose Output Directory**: `rust_game/Packaged`
3. **Wait for packaging** (5-15 minutes)
4. **Check for success** in Output Log

### Step 4: Verify Output
Your packaged game should be at:
```
rust_game/Packaged/Windows/ActionRPGMultiplayerStart.exe
```

## âœ… Solution 3: Project File Fix (Already Applied)

I've already updated your `.uproject` file to disable the Fab plugin:

```json
{
    "Name": "Fab",
    "Enabled": false
}
```

## ðŸŽ® After Successful Packaging

Once you have a packaged game:

### Test Locally
```bash
cd rust_game/Packaged/Windows
./ActionRPGMultiplayerStart.exe
```

### Deploy to Pixel Streaming
```bash
# Copy game to pixel streaming container
docker cp rust_game/Packaged/Windows projekt-pixel_streaming-1:/app/game/

# Restart pixel streaming
docker-compose restart pixel_streaming

# Access at http://localhost:9070
```

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### If Manual Packaging Also Fails:

1. **Check Project Settings**:
   - Edit â†’ Project Settings â†’ Packaging
   - Set "Use Pak File" to true
   - Set "Create compressed cooked packages" to true

2. **Disable More Plugins**:
   - Disable any unused plugins in Edit â†’ Plugins
   - Focus on keeping only: EnhancedInput, PixelStreaming, HttpBlueprint

3. **Clean Project**:
   - Close UE5 Editor
   - Delete `Binaries`, `Intermediate`, `Saved` folders
   - Reopen project (will regenerate)

4. **Check UE5 Version**:
   - Ensure you're using UE5.4 (matches project)
   - Update if needed via Epic Games Launcher

### Common Issues:

- **"Cook failed"**: Usually plugin conflicts or corrupted intermediate files
- **"No executable found"**: Packaging succeeded but output location wrong
- **"Access denied"**: Run as administrator or check antivirus

## ðŸš€ Quick Test Commands

```bash
# Test the fixed packaging script
cd rust_game
bash package-ue5-fixed.sh

# Check if packaging worked
ls -la Packaged/Windows/

# Test the game locally
cd Packaged/Windows
./ActionRPGMultiplayerStart.exe
```

## ðŸ“‹ What's Different in the Fix

The fixed script:
- âœ… Explicitly disables Fab plugin
- âœ… Uses proper headless arguments
- âœ… Sets environment variables to avoid UI
- âœ… Better error handling and logging
- âœ… Creates launch scripts automatically

Try the fixed script first, then fall back to manual packaging if needed!
