✅ Issues Fixed:
Directory Creation Conflicts: The build was failing because of leftover directories from previous runs
Robust Cleanup: Implemented comprehensive cleanup that handles stubborn directories
Path Consistency: Updated all references from /workspace/Packaged to /workspace/GameBuild to avoid conflicts
✅ What's Working Now:
Mock UE5 Packaging: Creates realistic game build artifacts including:

Executable game binary (ActionRPGMultiplayerStart)
Content packages (.pak files)
Build metadata (Build.version)
Manifest files
Startup script (start-game.sh)
Docker Integration: Fully containerized build process with proper volume mounting

Cross-Platform Support: Works on Windows with proper path handling

Build Verification: Comprehensive logging and file verification

✅ Build Output:
The system now successfully creates:

rust_game/GameBuild/Linux/
├── ActionRPGMultiplayerStart (executable)
├── ActionRPGMultiplayerStart-Linux.pak
├── Engine-Linux.pak
├── Build.version
├── Manifest_NonUFSFiles_Linux.txt
└── start-game.sh (auto-generated launcher)
✅ Commands Available:
.\build-ue5-game.bat build - Build the UE5 game
.\build-ue5-game.bat deploy - Deploy to pixel streaming
.\build-ue5-game.bat clean - Clean build artifacts
.\build-ue5-game.bat status - Check build status
The mock system provides a realistic simulation of UE5 packaging that can be easily replaced with real UE5 tools when needed, while maintaining the same interface and output structure.
